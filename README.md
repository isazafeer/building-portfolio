This README.md will showcase what I have worked on for my challenge in Week 2.

I was tasked with creating my own portfolio using HTML and CSS, which I was taught in the previous week. 

Below, I have linked screenshots of my portfolio page on different device resolutions.

Strengths:

I was able to write the HTML file fairly fluently, with some assistance from my independant research. Being able to implement elements such as text, images, buttons, achors, and links was no issue as they are the foundation/basics of most web pages.
